# Particle-Explosion

The project was to manage a bunch of virtual particles which appeared on the screen with a
gradual color change that produced blurry effect.
Designed this project using C++ and Eclipse IDE to control the impact of virtual particles
animating on the screen.
Used coding techniques to create header files and then to use these header files in further classes
in order to prevent duplicate code.
